# The Journey To DataScience and ML Engineering
- Error handling
- Decorators
- Containers
- Collections
- Files
- Closures
- Inheritance
- Functions
## Context Managers
  - Context manager represents code that runs before and after the with-stament's block
## Strings and representations
  - Python supports two strings representation
  - __reper__() and __str__()
- Organizing large functions
## How to learn Data Science
   - Plan
      * Setting learning goals
      * create your own personal curriculum
      * Making a schedule
      * Consistency
      * Accountability
   - Learn
      * Learn just enough to start buliding
      * Apply Pomodoro to manage learning time
      * Minimize stuck time
        - get stuck?
        - move on and come back to it later
   - Build
   - Explain
     * Explain your model to others
     * Teach others
     * Write blog posts
     * Build well documented GitHub repository
